# Titanic Survival
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew died in this tragedy. One of the reasons that led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboat. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.
